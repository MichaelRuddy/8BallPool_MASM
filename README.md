This project was originally completed 5/2020 with M. Sherrick and E. Ulloa and was not intially on Github.  I created this repository to show my work in assembly programming.
A properly configured MASM enviorment is required to run the application.  I will be updating this repo with screenshots of example outputs ASAP.
A high level diagram of the program is availible in the Project Report.
